P5M (Processing Modules) is a simple way to inject modules to your Processing Project. This is for now an experimental tool for [Codepoems](https://github.com/necsoft/codepoems), an experimental IDE I'm working on.  

**If you want to add your module**, it's really simple, you have to fork this P5M repo and pull request your module.

## Simple rules for publishing

* The modules have the prefix "P5M_" (this is the way I filter this files in Codepoems)
* Write a short description of the module.
* Add some examples! 

## Modules examples

* [P5M_ArrayShuffler](https://github.com/necsoft/P5M_ArrayShuffler): Simple way to shuffle arrays in Processing.
* [P5M_RuntimeMonitor](https://github.com/necsoft/P5M_RuntimeMonitor): Runtime monitor for Processing.
